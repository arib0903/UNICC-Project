## Overview
AI-Studio project developed in association with Cornell Tech, the Break Through Tech AI program, and the United Nations International Computing Centre. A collaboration with a team of five leveraging machine learning to detect misinformation on twitter about climate change and renewable resources.

## Objective
Develop a model to identify misinformation, aiding stakeholders in promoting accurate information.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy

## Dataset Description
Utilizes Twitter data, categorized into misinformation and factual information for training.

## Data Preprocessing and Analysis
The preprocessing phase involved cleaning text data, normalizing text cases, and extracting features through methods like TF-IDF vectorization.

## Model Development
Explores various models, from linear regression, feed forward neural network, and gradient boosted tree model, focusing on accuracy and generalization.

## Results and Performance Evaluation
Models show high accuracy in distinguishing misinformation, evaluated using the AUC score.
