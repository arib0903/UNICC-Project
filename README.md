## Overview
AI-Studio project developed in association with Cornell Tech, the Break Through Tech AI program, and the United Nations International Computing Centre. A collaboration with a team of five leveraging machine learning to detect misinformation on twitter about climate change and renewable resources.

## Objective
Develop a model to identify misinformation, aiding stakeholders in promoting accurate information.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy

## Dataset Description
Utilizes Twitter data, categorized into misinformation and factual information for training.

## Data Preprocessing and Analysis
The preprocessing phase involved cleaning text data, normalizing text cases, and extracting features through methods like TF-IDF vectorization.

## Model Development
Explores various models, such as
- <strong>Logistic regression</strong>
- <strong>Feed Forward Neural Network</strong>
-  <strong>Gradient Boosted Tree Model</strong>

Each focusing on accuracy and generalization.

## Feature Engineering
The sentiment analysis in our project involved analyzing the emotional tone of tweets using natural language processing techniques. We categorized sentiments into negative, positive, or neutral, enriching the dataset with these sentiment scores. This additional layer of features aimed to enhance the model's capability to distinguish between misinformation and factual content

## Results and Performance Evaluation
Models show high accuracy in distinguishing misinformation, evaluated using the AUC score.
